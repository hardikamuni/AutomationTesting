# AutomationTestingProject

This project was developed as a part of academic requirement in IT Quality Assurance course at Illinois State University.

We chose Nordstrom.com to write automation test scripts using Selenium Web Driver and Cucumber (Behavior Driven Development).

Below are the functionalities which we have automated in this project:

1. Sign-up process for all the users.
2. Sign-in process for all the users.
3. Validation of location based on the zipcode through Google Maps API.
4. Searching an item in shopping cart.
5. Applying various sorting criteria for searching and sorting items.
6. Adding one and multiple items in shopping cart.
7. Checking-out from the shopping cart.
8. Adding an appointment with the personal stylist.

I learnt about the concept of finding non-changing X-Paths, switching iFrames, data driven testing, implicit and explicit wait
and I gained very strong hands-on experience of writing robust automation testing scripts using Selenium web driver and Cucumber.
